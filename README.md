# MemoryLLMAgentProject

personal project by Juli Huang. self-exploring concepts such as agent policy, memory, and environment.

In this project, I research how LLM-based agents should decide what to remember under strict memory and cost constraints, using online learning and controlled evaluation rather than heuristic memory systems.
